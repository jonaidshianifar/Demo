# 🤖 Human-Reward Q-Learning Demo  
**Teach an RL Agent Using Your Own Feedback — Interactive, Visual, Beginner-Friendly**

Have you ever wondered how Reinforcement Learning agents actually learn?  
Or wanted to start learning RL but everything felt too theoretical?

This project brings RL to life through an **interactive visual demo** where **you** teach the agent using human feedback — no fixed reward function, no complex code. Just direct reinforcement learning, right in your browser.

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists
Reinforcement Learning can feel abstract.  
Equations, value functions, Bellman updates — it’s not always easy to *see* what’s happening.

So I built a tool that makes the learning process intuitive:

- The agent moves.
- **You choose -1 / 0 / +1.**
- The Q-table updates live.
- The policy evolves based on *your* guidance.

It’s RL explained through interaction instead of theory.

Perfect for:
- Students  
- Teachers  
- Researchers  
- Anyone curious about AI and autonomy

## 🌟 Features

### 🧠 Human-in-the-loop RL  
The agent learns entirely from your feedback.  
You shape the reward → you shape the policy.

### 📊 Real-Time Visualization  
Watch:
- Q-values change  
- Policy improve  
- Exploration vs exploitation  

### 🎚 Adjustable RL Parameters  
Change and experiment with:
- **Alpha** (learning rate)  
- **Gamma** (discount)  
- **Epsilon** (exploration)

### 📘 RL Basics Page (`rl.html`)  
Clear explanations of:
- Reinforcement Learning  
- Q-learning  
- Actor-Critic  
- PPO  
- SAC  
- Where human-reward learning fits
